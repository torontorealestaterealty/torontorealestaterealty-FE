      "question": "Does it show anywhere that my license is parked?",
      "answer": "No, it does not. 'Parking your license' is simply a term used to indicate that you've chosen to reduce your level of activity in the real estate market, but it does not impact your official standing as a licensed real estate professional. You remain a RECO-licensed agent and can continue to complete transactions as you see fit. It's a flexible option that gives you the freedom to adjust your workload without the constraints of full membership."

    {
      "question": "Can I really do transactions as a RECO Licensed Realtor and not belong to any board? Never heard of this!",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely! Membership in a Real Estate Board is not mandatory. The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) is the only regulatory body that governs your ability to trade in real estate. When you are licensed with RECO, you are authorized to conduct real estate transactions anywhere in Ontario and with any type of real estate transaction—you do not need to be a member of any board. Think of board membership as simply a 'club' membership, not a legal requirement. Feel free to reach out to RECO directly at 1 (416) 207-4800 for more information."

      "question": "Will I be able to show MLS or Board Listings to my clients and put in offers?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can. Nothing changes when you park your license. You can still show MLS or Board Listings to your clients, just like you would as a full Board member. All you need to do is call the Listing Brokerage, provide your details, and request the showing time. The process remains the same—there's no difference in how transactions are handled."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get information on properties for sale as a NON-Board member?",
      "answer": "The best option for accessing MLS listings as a non-Board member is realtor.ca. Realtor.ca provides the same MLS information that's available on Board MLS systems. The data on realtor.ca is sourced from the exact same MLS systems that Board members use. Additionally, the brokerage is always happy to assist by providing you with MLS reports and other relevant property information when needed."

    {
      "question": "Does the Brokerage offer assistance to agents, especially when making or negotiating offers?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely! As a Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus agent, you receive full brokerage support. We will help you review and ensure the accuracy of your offers, and our Broker of Record is available to assist with negotiating offers as needed. You're never alone in the process—we provide expert guidance every step of the way."

    {
      "question": "Can I still represent clients in buying and selling property if I park my license?",
      "answer": "Yes! When you park your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus, you can still conduct as many or as few real estate transactions as you like. The only thing you are not doing is paying board membership fees or accessing MLS through a board system. You retain your ability to represent clients, negotiate deals, and complete all types of real estate transactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get paid if I park my license?",
      "answer": "Just like with an active license, when you park your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus, your commissions are paid directly into your bank account via EFT or direct deposit. You keep 100% of the commission earned, with only a fixed transaction fee applied to each deal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want to become active again after parking my license?",
      "answer": "The beauty of parking your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus is that you have the flexibility to return to full activity whenever you wish. There are no complicated procedures to reactivate your status—just let us know, and you can start working again with full access to the tools and support you need."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I be required to pay monthly fees or additional charges if I park my license?",
      "answer": "No. Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus does not charge monthly fees, franchise fees, or desk fees. You will only pay a fixed annual fee depending on your level of activity (e.g., Park & Trade, Active Realtor), and a transaction fee for each real estate deal you complete."
