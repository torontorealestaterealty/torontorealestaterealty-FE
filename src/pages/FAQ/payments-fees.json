      "question": "How do I get paid if I park my license?",
      "answer": "Just like with an active license, when you park your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus, your commissions are paid directly into your bank account via EFT or direct deposit. You keep 100% of the commission earned, with only a fixed transaction fee applied to each deal."

    {
      "question": "Will I be required to pay monthly fees or additional charges if I park my license?",
      "answer": "No. Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus does not charge monthly fees, franchise fees, or desk fees. You will only pay a fixed annual fee depending on your level of activity (e.g., Park & Trade, Active Realtor), and a transaction fee for each real estate deal you complete."
