      "question": "Does it show anywhere that my license is parked?",
      "answer": "No, it does not. 'Parking your license' is simply a term used to indicate that you've chosen to reduce your level of activity in the real estate market, but it does not impact your official standing as a licensed real estate professional. You remain a RECO-licensed agent and can continue to complete transactions as you see fit. It's a flexible option that gives you the freedom to adjust your workload without the constraints of full membership."

    {
      "question": "Can I really do transactions as a RECO Licensed Realtor and not belong to any board? Never heard of this!",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely! Membership in a Real Estate Board is not mandatory. The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) is the only regulatory body that governs your ability to trade in real estate. When you are licensed with RECO, you are authorized to conduct real estate transactions anywhere in Ontario and with any type of real estate transaction—you do not need to be a member of any board. Think of board membership as simply a 'club' membership, not a legal requirement. Feel free to reach out to RECO directly at 1 (416) 207-4800 for more information."

      "question": "Can I still represent clients in buying and selling property if I park my license?",
      "answer": "Yes! When you park your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus, you can still conduct as many or as few real estate transactions as you like. The only thing you are not doing is paying board membership fees or accessing MLS through a board system. You retain your ability to represent clients, negotiate deals, and complete all types of real estate transactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I want to become active again after parking my license?",
      "answer": "The beauty of parking your license with Toronto Real Estate Realty Plus is that you have the flexibility to return to full activity whenever you wish. There are no complicated procedures to reactivate your status—just let us know, and you can start working again with full access to the tools and support you need."
