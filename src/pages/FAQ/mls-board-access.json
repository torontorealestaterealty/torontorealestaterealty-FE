      "question": "Will I be able to show MLS or Board Listings to my clients and put in offers?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can. Nothing changes when you park your license. You can still show MLS or Board Listings to your clients, just like you would as a full Board member. All you need to do is call the Listing Brokerage, provide your details, and request the showing time. The process remains the same—there's no difference in how transactions are handled."

      "question": "How do I get information on properties for sale as a NON-Board member?",
      "answer": "The best option for accessing MLS listings as a non-Board member is realtor.ca. Realtor.ca provides the same MLS information that's available on Board MLS systems. The data on realtor.ca is sourced from the exact same MLS systems that Board members use. Additionally, the brokerage is always happy to assist by providing you with MLS reports and other relevant property information when needed."
